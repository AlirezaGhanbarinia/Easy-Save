# Easy Save

Now it's very easy to save lists and objects!


## Examples

Assuming a model called `UserPrefs`:
```

public class UserPrefs {

    private String themeColor;
    private String soundOptionsURI;
    private boolean isShownTutorial;
    private int age;

    // all getter and setters below

    public String getThemeColor() {
        return themeColor;
    }

    public void setThemeColor(String themeColor) {
        this.themeColor = themeColor;
    }

    public String getSoundOptionsURI() {
        return soundOptionsURI;
    }

    public void setSoundOptionsURI(String soundOptionsURI) {
        this.soundOptionsURI = soundOptionsURI;
    }
    
    ...

}

```

So now we have our model, we can save or retrieve the data

###### Save an object

```
UserPrefs userPreferences = new UserPrefs();
new EasySave(context).saveModel("my key", userPreferences);
```

###### Retrieve an object

```
UserPrefs userPreferences = new EasySave(context).retrieveModel("my key", UserPrefs.class);
```
###### Save a list of objects

```
List<UserPrefs> myList= new ArrayList<>();

myList.add(user1);
myList.add(user2);
...

new EasySave(context).saveList("my keys", myList);
```

###### Retrieve a list of objects

```
List<UserPrefs> myList = new EasySave(context).retrieveList("my keys", User.Prefs[].class);
```

###### Warning

If the object or list does not exists, the EasySave will return `null`, so do the assertions.


## Installing

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```
allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```
and about dependences:
```
dependencies {
	        compile 'com.github.Guilherme-HRamos:Easy-Save:{$version}'
	}
```

## How this works

All objects and lists are saved in cache. If you want look the source code.
